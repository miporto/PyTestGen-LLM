## **Implementation Notes for LLM Agent**

### **Dependency Management with uv**
- Always use `uv add <package-name>` for production dependencies
- Use `uv add --dev <package-name>` for development dependencies
- Never create requirements.txt files - rely on pyproject.toml and uv.lock
- Run `uv sync` to install dependencies from uv.lock
- Use `uv run <command>` to execute commands in the virtual environment

### **Code Quality Standards with Updated Tools**
- Use `ruff format` for code formatting (replaces black and isort)
- Use `ruff check` for linting and import sorting
- Use `ty` for type checking instead of mypy
- Configure all tools in pyproject.toml under [tool.ruff] and [tool.ty] sections
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines enforced by ruff
- Use type hints for all function signatures validated by ty

### **Testing Requirements with pytest**
- Write unit tests for every function, class, and module using pytest
- Create comprehensive test fixtures for reusable test setup
- Use pytest markers to categorize tests (unit, integration, performance)
- Maintain test coverage above 90% measured with coverage.py
- Use mock objects and fixtures for external dependencies (LLM APIs, file system)
- Write both positive and negative test cases for all functionality

### **Error Handling Patterns**
- Use custom exception classes for domain-specific errors
- Log all errors with appropriate context information
- Provide user-friendly error messages in CLI outputs
- Implement graceful degradation for non-critical failures

### **Performance Considerations**
- Implement async operations for I/O-bound tasks
- Use caching for expensive operations (coverage analysis, LLM calls)
- Optimize memory usage for large codebases
- Monitor and optimize API usage costs

### **Project Structure with uv**
```
pytestgen-llm/
├── pyproject.toml          # Project configuration and dependencies
├── uv.lock                 # Locked dependency versions
├── src/

├── tests/                  # Test suite
└── docs/                   # Documentation
```

This task breakdown provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing the PyTestGen-LLM system according to the PRD specifications, with clear checkboxes for tracking progress, detailed subtasks for execution, and updated tooling requirements using uv, ruff, and ty.
