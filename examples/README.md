# Examples

This directory contains example code and learning materials for DSPy and PyTestGen-LLM.

## Files

- `dspy_learning.py`: Original DSPy 101 learning script demonstrating basic DSPy concepts
  - Question-answering with Chain of Thought
  - Module composition and chaining
  - LLM integration with OpenRouter

## Running the DSPy Learning Example

```bash
# Set up your OpenRouter API key
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Run the learning script
uv run python examples/dspy_learning.py
```

This example demonstrates the foundational DSPy concepts that PyTestGen-LLM builds upon.
